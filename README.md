# Unsupervised Learning (Customer Segmentation â€“ Credit Card Company)

# Objective

The goal of this project is to help a credit card company identify different customer segments
based on key characteristics (such as income, age, debt, etc.) using unsupervised learning.
This segmentation will help the company make informed marketing decisions for promoting
specific credit card products tailored to each customer group.

# Problem Statement

This task applies Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) to segment credit card customers into meaningful groups based on their spending and usage patterns. The goal is to identify customer segments for better marketing strategies.

# Technologies Used

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Pandas & NumPy

- Scikit-learn (K-Means clustering, preprocessing)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn

# Key Insights/Results

- Clustering reveals distinct customer segments with similar behaviors.

- Businesses can target marketing strategies based on segment characteristics.

- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) may improve visualization and cluster interpretation.
